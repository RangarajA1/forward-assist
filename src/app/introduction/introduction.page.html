          <b>Empowering Women Veterans</b> <br>
          Forward Assist recognise that women veterans are a hidden, marginalised and frequently ignored and forgotten population. 
          We prefer to use the term ‘Woman Veteran’ over ‘Female Veteran’…Why? 
          Well, its all about respect, because the word 'female' has biological overtones and 
          focusses too narrowly on the reproductive system which can be linked to any female animal whilst the word 'women' describes a human. 
          We are actively campaigning for gender specific mental health support services for women who were harassed and sexually abused during military service. 
          Salute Her aim to ensure  that all ‘Women Veterans’ have a choice in both service design and delivery.
          Team Salute Her are the only UK ‘gender specific’ support service, to offer tri-service, trauma informed, 
          mental health therapy and interventions for survivors of in-service sexual abuse. 
          We also provide needs led  wrap around holistic care to women service personnel and veterans in a single sex environment.
